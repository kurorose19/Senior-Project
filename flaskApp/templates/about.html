        <p>&emsp;The goal of MindSanctuary is to help our users maintain a healthy mind through journal writing and mood observation. We plan to benefit the userâ€™s mental health by providing recommendations, such as movies to watch, songs to listen to, and articles/books to read that help our users better understand their emotions.  While we do want to replicate the same success as other health applications, this health application will attempt to try not to ask users direct questions and will be more focused on obtaining data from the logs the user fills out in order to make our recommendations.
